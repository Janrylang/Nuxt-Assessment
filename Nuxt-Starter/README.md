# Vue / Nuxt Skills Assessment

A simple **Product Store** application built with Nuxt 3 and Pinia. The app has **8 intentional bugs** that you need to find and fix.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Your Task

This application has 8 bugs across different files. Each bug tests a fundamental Vue/Nuxt/Pinia concept. Find and fix all of them to make the app work correctly.

**Expected behavior when all bugs are fixed:**

- The home page loads and displays a grid of 6 products
- The search bar filters products by name as you type
- Clicking "Add to Cart" on any product updates the cart count in the header
- The cart badge and total in the header persist across page navigation
- Clicking "View Details" navigates to the product detail page and shows the product info
- The detail page "Add to Cart" button also updates the shared cart

## Time Limit

You have **1.5 hours** to find and fix all 8 bugs.

Good luck!
